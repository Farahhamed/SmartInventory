Smart Inventory is an innovative project that leverages RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags on items and employees to enable precise tracking of inventory movements and enhance security through personnel access monitoring. This system seamlessly integrates with Odoo, a comprehensive business management software, to make use of its ready-made features for inventory management, including stock control techniques and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) capabilities.

Furthermore, Smart Inventory incorporates machine learning algorithms to forecast future purchases, providing strategic insights to optimize stock management. By analyzing historical data and market trends, the system can make accurate predictions, enabling businesses to proactively manage their inventory levels and avoid stockouts or overstocking.
